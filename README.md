# jsredirect

A static webpage that redirects based on a tag added to the query string to a url. 

## Why is this a thing?
The problem with web redirects is they need a server to store the list of outbound links. This method allows you to redirect by just visiting this staticly hosted page. Updates to the list can be approved using a Pull Request and Branch Protection ensures the review takes place.
